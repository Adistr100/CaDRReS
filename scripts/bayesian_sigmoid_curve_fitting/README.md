# Bayesian Sigmoid Curve Fitting

Here we provide scripts for Bayesian sigmoid curve fitting of dose-response values from CCLE and GDSC. The dose-response curve is based on [logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function). For more detail, please check the supplementary of CaDRReS paper.
